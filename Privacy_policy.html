            <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is Biswajit's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our website and other sites we own and operate.</p>

            <p>We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we’re collecting it and how it will be used.</p>

            <p>We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service. What data we store, we’ll protect within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.</p>

            <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
            <p>Like most website operators, Biswajit Jena collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Biswajit's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Biswajit's visitors use its website. From time to time, Biswajit Jena may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
